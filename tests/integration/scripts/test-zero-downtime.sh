# Script to run zero downtime tests by executing a godog integration test for a given handler and sending requests to
# the url exposed by an APIRule.
#
# The following process is executed:
# 1. Start the zero downtime requests in the background. The requests will be sent once the APIRule is ready and the
# exposed host is reachable. The requests will be sent in a loop until the APIRule is deleted.
#  - Wait for 5 min until APIRule exists
#  - Wait for 5 min until APIRule status is OK
#  - If handler is jwt, wait for 1 min until the OAuth2 mock server is available and get the bearer token
#  - Wait for 1 min until the host in the APIRule is available
#  - Send requests in parallel to the exposed host until the requests fail and in this case check if the APIRule
#    still exists to determine if the test failed or succeeded.
# 2. Run the godog test that will migrate the APIRule from v1beta1 to v2alpha1 parallel to the requests.
# 3. Check if the zero downtime requests were successful.
