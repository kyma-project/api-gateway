# API Gateway

## What is API Gateway?

API Gateway provides functionalities that allow you to expose and secure APIs by using [Ory Oathkeeper](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper) and the [Istio service mesh](https://istio.io/) resources.

## API Gateway Operator

API Gateway Operator is a component of the Kyma runtime that handles resource reconciliation and manages the application of the API Gateway configuration. Within the API Gateway Operator, there are two controllers: [APIGateway Controller](./docs/user/00-10-overview-api-gateway-controller.md), which applies the configuration specified in APIGateway custom resource (CR), and [APIRule Controller](./docs/user/00-20-overview-api-rule-controller.md), which applies the configuration specified in APIRule CR.
