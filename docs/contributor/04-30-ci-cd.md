# CI/CD

## Environments

Some of the jobs that are running in this repository are configured to run in context of a repository environment. This allows ensuring that jobs that need access to repository secrets are manually allowed by repository maintainers.

There are two environments configured:
- 'internal' - used when the job is run by repository collaborator
- 'restricted' - used when the job is run by outside collaborator. The run need to by approved by @kyma-project/goat.
