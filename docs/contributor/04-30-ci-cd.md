# CI/CD

## Environments

In this repository, certain jobs are set up to run within the context of the repository environment. This ensures that the jobs that require access to repository Secrets are manually allowed by repository maintainers.

There are two environments configured:
- 'internal' - used when a repository collaborator runs a job in the repository
- 'restricted' - used when an outside collaborator runs a job in the repository. The run must be approved by @kyma-project/goat.
