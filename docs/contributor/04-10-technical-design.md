# Technical Design of Kyma API Gateway Operator

API Gateway Operator consists of two controllers that reconcile different CRs. To understand the reasons for using a single operator with multiple controllers instead of multiple operators, refer to the [Architecture Decision Record](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/495).
API Gateway Operator has a dependency on [Istio](https://istio.io/) and [Ory Oathkeeper](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper), and it installs Ory Oathkeeper itself.

The following diagram illustrates the APIRule reconciliation process and the resources created in the process:

## APIGateway Controller

APIGateway Controller is a [Kubernetes controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/), which is implemented using the [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) framework.
The controller is responsible for handling the [APIGateway CR](../user/custom-resources/apigateway/04-00-apigateway-custom-resource.md).

### Reconciliation
APIGateway Controller reconciles the APIGateway CR with each change. If you don't make any changes, the reconciliation process occurs at the default interval of 10 hours, as determined by the [Kubernetes controller-runtime](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime).
APIGateway Controller reconciles only the oldest APIGateway CR on the cluster. It sets the status of other CRs to `Warning`.
If a failure occurs during the reconciliation process, the default behavior of the [Kubernetes controller-runtime](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime) is to use exponential backoff requeue.

Before deleting the APIGateway CR, APIGateway Controller first checks if there are any APIRule or [Istio Virtual Service](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service) resources that reference the default Kyma [Gateway](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/) `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`. If any such resources are found, they are listed in the logs of the controller, and the APIGateway CR's status is set to `Warning` to indicate that there are resources blocking the deletion. If there are existing Ory Oathkeeper Access Rules on the cluster, APIGateway Controller also sets the status to `Warning` and does not delete the APIGateway CR.
The `gateways.operator.kyma-project.io/api-gateway-reconciliation` finalizer protects the deletion of the APIGateway CR. Once no more APIRule and VirtualService resources are blocking the deletion of the APIGateway CR, the APIGateway CR can be deleted. Deleting the APIGateway CR also deletes the default Kyma Gateway. 

## APIRule Controller

APIRule Controller is a [Kubernetes controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/), which is implemented using the [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) framework.
The controller is responsible for handling the [APIRule CR](../user/custom-resources/apirule/04-10-apirule-custom-resource.md).
Additionally, the controller watches the [`api-gateway-config`](../user/custom-resources/apirule/04-20-apirule-istio-jwt-access-strategy.md) to configure the JWT handler.

APIRule Controller has a conditional dependency to APIGateway Controller in terms of the default APIRule domain. If you don't configure any domain in APIGateway CR, APIRule Controller uses the default Kyma Gateway domain as the default value for creating VirtualServices.

>**NOTE:** For now, you can only use the default domain in APIGateway CR. The option to configure your own domain will be added at a later time. See the [epic task](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/130).

### Reconciliation
APIRule Controller reconciles APIRule CR with each change. If you don't make any changes, the process occurs at the default interval of 10 hours.
You can use the [API Gateway Operator paramteres](../user/technical-reference/05-00-api-gateway-operator-parameters.md) to adjust this interval.
In the event of a failure during the reconciliation, APIRule Controller performs the reconciliation again after one minute.

The following diagram illustrates the reconciliation process of APIRule and the created resources:
