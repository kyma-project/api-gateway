## Breaking changes

The APIRule API in version `v1beta1` is no longer available. The only supported versions are `v2alpha1` and `v2`.
APIRules that have been created using the `v1beta1` version will not be automatically migrated, but will
remain functional. However, you will not be able to create new APIRules or update existing ones using the `v1beta1` version.
Please migrate your APIRules using the `v2` API version.
See the [migration guide](../user/apirule-migration/README.md) for more details.
