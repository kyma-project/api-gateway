## New Features
- Added support for managing NetworkPolicies required by API Gateway in secured environments as an optional field. [#2519](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/2519)

## Bug Fixes
- Now, the API Gateway module applies the `kyma-project.io/module` label to all the resources it creates, along with other recommended Kubernetes labels. See [issue #2307](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2307).
- APIRule subresources are now created with two dedicated owner labels `apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/name` and `apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/namespace` instead of embedding long owner information in a single label. This prevents label-length-related reconciliation failures of APIRule resources.
- RateLimit resources are now reconciled correctly when only default bucket is defined without any additional buckets. See [issue #2380](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2380).
- In Kyma Dashboard, the APIRule's host in the details view is now a clickable link. [#2435](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/2435)
- Fixed an error when error was thrown when shoot-info was not present on a cluster. [#2519](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/2519)
