## Bug Fixes
- Now, the API Gateway module applies the `kyma-project.io/module` label to all the resources it creates, along with other recommended Kubernetes labels. See [issue #2307](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2307).
- APIRule subresources are now created with two dedicated owner labels `apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/name` and `apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/namespace` instead of embedding long owner information in a single label. This prevents label-length-related reconciliation failures of APIRule resources.
