## APIRule v1beta1 Deletion

APIRule `v1beta1` has been deprecated and scheduled for deletion. The APIRule `v1beta1` deletion will occur in three steps. This release implements the first step of this process:

1. Now, Kyma dashboard does not display APIRule custom resources (CRs) in version `v1beta1`. All APIRules v1beta1 are fully operational from the command line, and you are still be able to manage them using kubectl. Additionally, this change does not affect any pipelines that manage APIRules using Kubernetes utilities such as kubectl or helm.

The following steps will be introduced with the next releases of the API Gateway module:

2. You won't be able to create APIRule CRs `v1beta1` in new clusters. In existing clusters, you will still be able to create and modify APIRule CRs `v1beta1`.
3. You won't be able to create APIRule CRs `v1beta1` in new and existing clusters, modify existing APIRule CRs `v1beta1`, or delete them. All APIRule `v1beta1` configurations set up prior to this restriction will remain active and continue to function as expected. The API Gateway module will manage and reconcile resources based on the existing APIRule settings.

**Required action**: You must migrate all your APIRules to version `v2`. For more information, see [APIRule Migration](../user/apirule-migration/). We strongly recommend starting the migration as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions.

## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed conversion from APIRule `v1beta1` to `v2`. The conversion now sets all convertible fields in the APIRule's **spec**. [#1983](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/1983)
