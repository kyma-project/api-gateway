The release 2.7 of the API Gateway module includes the fully functional version of APIRule `v2alpha1` with [**noAuth**](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-15-api-rule-access-strategies?id=configuration-of-the-noauth-access-strategy), [**jwt**](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-15-api-rule-access-strategies?id=configuration-of-the-jwt-access-strategy), and [**extAuth**](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-15-api-rule-access-strategies?id=configuration-of-the-extauth-access-strategy) access strategies. Version `v2alpha1` is not meant for use in a production environment but for testing purposes before the introduction of stable APIRule `v2`. 

For SAP BTP, Kyma runtime, API Gateway 2.7 will be rolled out to the regular channel on October 28, 2024 in the regular channel. After this date, users will be required to start testing the migration procedure. To learn more, see the [APIRule Migration blog post](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-noauth-and-jwt-handlers/ba-p/13882833). It provides the timeline for deletion of APIRule v1beta1 and covers the following migration scenarios:
    - From **noop**, **allow**, or **no_auth** handler in version `v1beta1` to the **noAuth** handler in version `v2alpha1`
    - From the **jwt** handler in version `v1beta1` to the new configuration of the **jwt** handler in version `v2alpha1`
The migration procedure from Oathkeeper-based handlers to the new noAuth handler will be published soon in the next blog post. For now, see the tutorial Exposing Workload with extAuth.

## Deprecation

- This release instroduces deprecatin of the APIRule custom resource in version `v1beta1`.

## New Features

- We've added support for short host name for APIRule in version `v2alpha1` ([#1311](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1311)). If you only provide the leftmost is provided in the **spec.rules** field of an APIRule CR, it uses the domain name from the referenced Gateway, expanding the host to `<label>.<gateway domain>`. See [Sample Custom Resources](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-10-apirule-custom-resource?id=sample-custom-resource).

## Bug Fixes

- We've fixed the wildcard path format and the validation of the rule path in an APIRule ([#1285](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1285)).
