## New Features

- Implement a watch mechanism to ensure that DNSEntry is up to date with the IP and host of the `istio-ingressgateway` service ([#1834](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1834)).
- Decrease the default reconciliation time to safeguard against possible scheduling errors ([#1759](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1759)).
