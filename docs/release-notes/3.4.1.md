## Bug Fixes
- APIRule subresources are now created with two dedicated owner labels `apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/name` and `apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/namespace` instead of embedding long owner information in a single label. This prevents label-length-related reconciliation failures of APIRule resources.
- RateLimit resources are now reconciled correctly when only default bucket is defined without any additional buckets. See [issue #2380](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2380).
