# Bug Fixes

- Fix behaviour of in-cluster connectivity when using JWT handler in APIRule. Now, in-cluster connectivity is blocked. [#1868](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1868)
- Now, when you create an APIRule with the `noAuth` access strategy, it is validated if the target workload has an Istio sidecar proxy injected. [#1890](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1890)
