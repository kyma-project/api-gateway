## New Features
If you expose a path using a wildcard pattern, now you can also expose the same path without including the trailing slash. For example, if you have a rule that exposes `example.com/path/*`, you can also expose `example.com/path` without the slash at the end. ([#1625](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1625))

## Bug Fixes
We’ve changed the hardcoded algorithm from `RSA256` to `RS256`. This change ensures that JWT tokens are processed correctly by the Ory Oathkeeper, resolving the error message `signing key 'XXX' declares unsupported algorithm "RSA256"`. ([#1647](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1647))
