## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed a bug where APIRules `v2` allowed applying empty spec. See [#2271](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/2271).
- RateLimit resources are now reconciled correctly when only default bucket is defined without any additional buckets. See [issue #2380](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2380).
