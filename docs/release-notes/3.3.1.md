## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed a bug where APIRules `v2` allowed applying empty spec. See [#2271](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/2271).
- APIRule subresources are now created with two dedicated owner labels `apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/name` and `apirule.gateway.kyma-project.io/namespace` instead of embedding long owner information in a single label. This prevents label-length-related reconciliation failures of APIRule resources.
