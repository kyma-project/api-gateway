## New Features

- Change Ory Oathkeeper's scaling to be based only on CPU utilization. This adjustment ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, as Oathkeeper memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.
- Introduce APIRule in version `v1beta2` [#996](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/996)
