We are pleased to announce the release of API Gateway 2.4.0, the biggest release since the release 2.0.0 which introduced the modular architecture.
This release introduces the new, entirely Istio-based `v2alpha1` version of the APIRule CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) and custom resource (CR).
The new version of the APIRule CRD is a significant step towards a stable API Gateway API.

## The Status of the `APIRule` CRD in Version `v1beta1`

The APIRule CR in version `v1beta1` will become deprecated in 2024. While both versions are currently supported, take into consideration that you'll be required to perform some manual migration steps in the following months. If you use the `no_auth` or `jwt` access strategies, you will have to change the configuration of your APIRule CR from `v1beta1` to the respective one in version `v2alpha1`. If you use the access strategies that rely on Ory Oathkeeper or `allow`, you'll be required to migrate to the `jwt` access strategy or `noAuth`. The access strategies that are not supported in the new version are:
- `allow` 
- `noop`
- `unauthorized`
- `anonymous`
- `cookie_session`
- `bearer_token`
- `oauth2_client_credentials`
- `oauth2_introspection`
- `jwt` based on Ory Oathkeeper

When the time comes, and we announce the deprecation, you'll see the detailed migration procedure in [API Gateway Resources](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/README). For SAP BTP, Kyma runtime users, the deprecation will be also announced in a What's New note. For now, we encourage you to learn more about the new version and follow the [APIRule `v1alpha2` tutorials](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/tutorials/v2alpha1/README).

## Version `v2alpha1` of the APIRule CRD

The structure of the `v2alpha1` API is defined in [`v2alpha1` custom resource documentation](../user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-10-apirule-custom-resource.md).

The new version of the `APIRule` CRD introduces the following changes:
- The `APIRule` authorization policy is now based solely on Istio. The `APIRule` CRD no longer supports the Ory Oathkeeper authorization policy.
- The available access strategies are now limited to `JWT`, `NoAuth`, and soon incoming is support for `ExtAuth`. You can find more information about the strategies in the [access strategies documentation](../user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-15-api-rule-access-strategies.md) and the [ADR](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/938) for ExtAuth strategy.

The new version is not backward compatible with `v1beta1`.


## New Features

- Change Ory Oathkeeper's scaling to be based only on CPU utilization. This adjustment ensures that the scaling is more responsive to traffic changes, as Oathkeeper memory utilization is not a good indicator of the traffic load.
- Introduce APIRule in version `v2alpha1` [#996](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/996)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix rendering of APIRule list when multiple APIRules exist [#1069](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/1069)
