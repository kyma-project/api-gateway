After much anticipation, we proudly announce the release of version 2.0.0 of API Gateway. This is the first production release of the API Gateway module, which offers similar functionality to the API Gateway reconciler. In addition to APIRule Controller that was previously introduced, this release also includes support for the new module and its custom resource.
The API Gateway module will be added to [the collection of other modules](https://kyma-project.io/#/06-modules/README) that have already been separated from the classic Kyma as part of the modularization process. To better understand its capabilities, read the [documentation](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/tree/main/docs/user#readme). 
And now, the time has come for you to install the API Gateway module and share your feedback with us!

## New features

- Introduces API Gateway CRD
- Module installs Ory Oathkeeper v0.38.25 beta.1
- Module deploys default Kyma Gateway if enabled in API Gateway CR
