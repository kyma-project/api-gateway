After much anticipation, we proudly announce the first production release of the API Gateway module as the 2.0.0 relase of API Gateway. The release includes the APIRule controller as before, but also adds support for the new API Gateway module and its corresponding custom resource. The module will now be added to the collection of other modules that have already been separated from the classic Kyma as part of the modularization process. The API Gateway module offers similar functionality to the API Gateway reconciler. To better understand its capabilities, read the documentation. And now, the time has come for you to install the Istio module and share your feedback with us!

## New features

- Introduces API Gateway CRD
- Module installs Ory Oathkeeper v0.38.25 beta.1
- Module deploys default Kyma Gateway if enabled in API Gateway CR
- Support for API Gateway CR blocking deletion strategy when APIRules, ORY Oathkeeper Rules or Istio VirtualServices exist on the cluster
