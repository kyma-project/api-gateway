## New features
- You can now configure CORS with the use of APIRule. For more information, see the (PR)[https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/pull/760].

## Bug fixes

- We've implemented a validation mechanism to ensure that only valid HTTP methods are used in the configuration of APIRule access rules.
- The `allow` access strategy of APIRule access rules now enforces the correct access restriction to configured methods.
