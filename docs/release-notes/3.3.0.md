## APIRule `v1beta1` Deletion
This release introduces the second phase of APIRule `v1beta1` deletion. With API Gateway 3.3.0, you can no longer create APIRule CRs `v1beta1` in new clusters. In existing clusters, you can still create and modify APIRule CRs `v1beta1`. For more information on the deletion timeline for SAP BTP, Kyma runtime, see [APIRule `v1beta1` Migration Timeline](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform-internal/apirule-migration?locale=en-US&state=DRAFT&version=Internal#apirule-v1beta1-migration-timeline).

> [!NOTE]
> To make sure that support for your APIRules is maintained, you must migrate them to version `v2`. To learn how to do this, see [APIRule Migration](../user/apirule-migration/README.md).

## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed a bug where APIRules `v2alpha1` and `v2` were set to the `Error` state when the target workload was in the mesh with the Istio proxy running in native sidecar mode. See [#2100](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2100).
- We've fixed a bug that caused AuthorizationPolicy creation to fail for APIRules in namespaces with names longer than 36 characters. Now, namespace names up to 63 characters are supported. [#2143](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2143) 
- The APIRule CR's status is now correctly updated when **spec.gateway** uses the old legacy format. See [#2067](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2067).
- We've fixed the **jwt** and **ext-auth** setup of RequestAuthentication, which is now created for all workloads, regardless of whether they have the `app` label or not. See [#2237](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2237).
