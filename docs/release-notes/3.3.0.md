## Bug Fixes
- We've fixed a bug where APIRules `v2alpha1` and `v2` were set to the `Error` state when the target workload was in the mesh with the Istio proxy running in native sidecar mode. See [#2100](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2100).
- We've fixed a bug that caused AuthorizationPolicy creation to fail for APIRules in namespaces with names longer than 36 characters. Now, namespace names up to 63 characters are supported. [#2143](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2143) 
- The APIRule CR's status is now correctly updated when **spec.gateway** uses the old legacy format. See [#2067](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2067).
- We've fixed the **jwt** and **ext-auth** setup of RequestAuthentication, which is now created for all workloads, regardless of whether they have the `app` label or not. See [#2237](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/2237).
