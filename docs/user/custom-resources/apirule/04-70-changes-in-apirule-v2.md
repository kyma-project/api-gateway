# Changes Introduced in APIRule v2alpha1 and v2

This document presents all the significant changes that APIRule `v2alpha1` introduces. Since version `v2alpha1` is identical to the stable version `v2`, you must consider these changes when migrating either to version `v2` or `v2alpha1`.

See the changes introduced in the new versions:

  - [Removed Support for Oathkeeper OAuth2 Handlers](#removed-support-for-oathkeeper-oauth2-handlers)

- [Removed Support for Opaque Tokens](#removed-support-for-opaque-tokens)

> [!WARNING]
> APIRule CR in version `v1beta1` has been deprecated and will be removed on May 12, 2025. Version `v2alpha1`, introduced for testing purposes, will become deprecated on April 15n , 2025, and removed on June 16, 2025. The stable APIRule `v2` is planned to be introduced in the regular channel on April 15, 2025.
> 
> To migrate your APIRule CRs to version `v2`, follow the procedure described in the blog posts [APIRule migration - noAuth and jwt handlers](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-noauth-and-jwt-handlers/ba-p/13882833) and [APIRule migration - Ory Oathkeeper based OAuth2 handlers](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-ory-oathkeeper-based-oauth2-handlers/ba-p/13896184). Since the APIRule CRD `v2alpha1` is identical to `v2`, the migration procedure for both versions is the same.

## A Workload Must Be in the Istio Service Mesh

To use APIRules in versions `v2` or `v2alpha1`, the workload that an APIRule exposes must be in the Istio service mesh. If the workload is not inside the Istio service mesh, the APIRule does not work as expected.

**Required action**: To add a workload to the Istio service mesh, [enable Istio sidecar proxy injection](https://kyma-project.io/#/istio/user/tutorials/01-40-enable-sidecar-injection).

## Internal Traffic to Workloads Is Blocked by Default

By default, the access to the workload from internal traffic is blocked. This approach aligns with Kyma's "secure by default" principle. In one of the future releases of the API Gateway module, the APIRule CR will contain a new field **internalTraffic** set to `Deny` by default. This field will allow you to permit traffic from the CR. For more information on this topic, see issue [#1632](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/1632).

## CORS Policy Is Not Applied by Default

Version `v1beta1` applied the following CORS configuration by default:
```yaml
corsPolicy:
  allowOrigins: ["*"]
  allowMethods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"]
  allowHeaders: ["Authorization", "Content-Type", "*"]
```

Versions `v2` and `v2alpha1` do not apply these default values. If the **corsPolicy** field is empty, the CORS configuration is not applied. For more information, see [architecture decision record #752](https://github.com/kyma-project/api-gateway/issues/752).

**Required action**: To use default CORS values defined in the APIRule `v1beta1`, you must explicitly define them in the **corsPolicy** field.

## Path Specification Must Not Contain Regexp

APIRule in versions `v2` and `v2alpha1` does not support regexp in the **spec.rules.path** field of APIRule CR. Instead, it supports the use of the `{*}` and `{**}` operators. See the supported configurations:
- Use the exact path (for example, `/abc`). It matches the specified path exactly.
- Use the `{*}` operator (for example, `/foo/{*}` or `/foo/{*}/bar`).  This operator represents any request that matches the given pattern, with exactly one path segment replacing the operator.
- Use the `{**}` operator (for example, `/foo/{**}` or `/foo/{**}/bar`). This operator represents any request that matches the pattern with zero or more path segments in the operator’s place. It must be the last operator in the path.
- Use the wildcard path `/*`, which matches all paths. It’s equivalent to the `/{**}` path. If your configuration in APIRule `v1beta1` used such a path as `/foo(.*)`, when migrating to the new versions, you must define configurations for two separate paths: `/foo` and `/foo/{**}`.

For more information on the APIRule specification, see [APIRule v2alpha1 Custom Resource](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-10-apirule-custom-resource).

**Required action**: Replace regexp expressions in the **spec.rules.path** field of your APIRule CRs with the `{*}` and `{**}` operators.

## JWT Configuration Requires Explicit Issuer URL

Versions `v2` and `v2alpha1` of APIRule introduce an additional mandatory configuration filed for JWT-based authorization - **issuer**. You must provide an explicit issuer URL in the APIRule CR. See an example configuration:

```yaml
rules:
- jwt:
    authentications:
        -   issuer: {YOUR_ISSUER_URL}
            jwksUri: {YOUR_JWKS_URI}
```
If you use Cloud Identity Services, you can find the issuer URL in the OIDC well-known configuration at `https://{YOUR_TENANT}.accounts.ondemand.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

**Required action**: Add the **issuer** field to your APIRule specification when migrating to the new version. For more information on migration procedure for the `jwt` handler, see [SAP BTP, Kyma runtime: APIRule migration - noAuth and jwt handlers](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-noauth-and-jwt-handlers/ba-p/13882833).

## Removed Support for Oathkeeper
In one of the releases after 3.1.0, Oathkeeper will be moved to its own namespace. Support for Oathkeeper will be removed later. Once the support is removed, Oathkeeper will be installed in the clusters, but the API Gateway module will neither use it nor manage it.

### Removed Support for Oathkeeper OAuth2 Handlers
The APIRule CR in versions `v2` and `v2alpha1` does not support Oathkeeper OAuth2 handlers. Instead, it introduces the **extAuth** field, which you can use to configure an external authorizer.

**Required action**: Migrate your Oathkeeper-based OAuth2 handlers to use an external authorizer. To learn how to do this, see [SAP BTP, Kyma runtime: APIRule migration - Ory Oathkeeper-based OAuth2 handlers](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-ory-oathkeeper-based-oauth2-handlers/ba-p/13896184) and [Configuration of the extAuth Access Strategy](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-15-api-rule-access-strategies).

### Removed Support for Oathkeeper Mutators
The APIRule CR in versions `v2` and `v2alpha1` does not support Oathkeeper mutators. Request mutators are replaced with request modifiers defined in the **spec.rule.request** section of the APIRule CR. This section contains the request modification rules applied before the request is forwarded to the target workload. Token mutators are not supported in APIRules `v2` and `v2alpha1`. For that, you must define your own **extAuth** configuration.

**Required action**: Migrate your rules that rely on Oathkeeper mutators to use request modifiers or an external authorizer. For more information, see [Configuration of the extAuth Access Strategy](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-15-api-rule-access-strategies) and [APIRule v2alpha1 Custom Resource](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-10-apirule-custom-resource).

## Removed Support for Opaque Tokens

The APIRule CR in versions `v2` and `v2alpha1` does not support the usage of Opaque tokens. Instead, it introduces the **extAuth** field, which you can use to configure an external authorizer.

**Required action**: Migrate your rules that use Opaque tokens to use an external authorizer. For more information, see [Configuration of the extAuth Access Strategy](https://kyma-project.io/#/api-gateway/user/custom-resources/apirule/v2alpha1/04-15-api-rule-access-strategies).
