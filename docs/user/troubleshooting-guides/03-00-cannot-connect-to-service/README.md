# Issues with APIRules and Service Connection

If you have issues creating an APIRule custom resource (CR) or you've exposed a service but you cannot connect to it, see the troubleshooting guides related to:

- [APIRule CR in version v2alpha1](./v2alpha1/03-00-basic-diagnostics.md)
- [APIRule CR in version v1beta1](./03-00-basic-diagnostics.md)

> [!WARNING]
> APIRule in version `v1beta1` will become deprecated on October 28, 2024. To prepare for the introduction of the stable APIRule in version `v2`, you can start testing the API and the migration procedure using version `v2alpha1`. APIRule `v2alpha1` was introduced for testing purposes only and is not meant for use in a production environment. For more information, see the [APIRule migration blog post](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-noauth-and-jwt-handlers/ba-p/13882833).
