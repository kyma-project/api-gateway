# Issues with APIRules and Service Connection

If you have issues creating an APIRule custom resource (CR) or you've exposed a service but you cannot connect to it, see the troubleshooting guides related to:

- [APIRule CR in version v2alpha1](./v2alpha1/03-00-basic-diagnostics.md)
- [APIRule CR in version v1beta1](./03-00-basic-diagnostics.md)

> [!WARNING]
> APIRule in version `v1beta1` will become deprecated in 2024. Migrate to version `v2alpha1`.
