# Tutorials - Expose a Workload
Browse the API Gateway tutorials to learn how to expose workloads. The tutorials are available in two versions: one uses the APIRule resource in version `v2alpha1` and the other uses the APIRule resource in version `v1beta1`. 

> [!NOTE]
> APIRule CR in version `v1beta1` has been deprecated and will be removed in upcoming releases. Version `v2alpha1`, introduced for testing purposes, will become deprecated after the stable APIRule `v2` is promoted to the regular channel. The promotion of the APIRule `v2` to the regular channel has been postponed. We will keep you posted on the coming dates and changes.
> 
> To migrate your APIRule CRs to version `v2`, follow the procedure described in the blog posts [APIRule migration - noAuth and jwt handlers](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-noauth-and-jwt-handlers/ba-p/13882833) and [APIRule migration - Ory Oathkeeper based OAuth2 handlers](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-ory-oathkeeper-based-oauth2-handlers/ba-p/13896184). Since the APIRule CRD `v2alpha1` is identical to `v2`, the migration procedure for both versions is the same.
