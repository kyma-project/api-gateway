# Expose a Workload with Short Host Name

This tutorial demonstrates how to expose an unsecured instance of the HTTPBin Service using a short host name instead of the full domain name. Using a short host makes it simpler to apply APIRules because the domain name is automatically retrieved from the referenced Gateway, and you donâ€™t have to manually set it in each APIRule. This might be particularly useful when reconfiguring resources in a new cluster, as it reduces the chance of errors and streamlines the process.

> [!WARNING]
>  Exposing a workload to the outside world is a potential security vulnerability, so tread carefully. In a production environment, always secure the workload you expose with [JWT](../../01-50-expose-and-secure-a-workload/v2alpha1/01-52-expose-and-secure-workload-jwt.md).

## Prerequisites

* [Deploy a sample HTTPBin Service](../../01-00-create-workload.md).
* [Set up your custom domain](../../01-10-setup-custom-domain-for-workload.md) or use a Kyma domain instead.

## Steps

### Expose Your Workload

1. Depending on whether you use your custom domain or a Kyma domain, export the necessary values as environment variables:

  <!-- tabs:start -->
  #### **Custom Domain**

  ```bash
  export DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS={DOMAIN_NAME}
  export GATEWAY=$NAMESPACE/httpbin-gateway
  ```
  #### **Kyma Domain**

  ```bash
  export DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS={KYMA_DOMAIN_NAME}
  export GATEWAY=kyma-system/kyma-gateway
  ```
  <!-- tabs:end -->

2. To expose an instance of the HTTPBin Service, create the following APIRule:

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v2alpha1
    kind: APIRule
    metadata:
      name: httpbin
      namespace: $NAMESPACE
    spec:
      hosts:
        - httpbin
      service:
        name: $SERVICE_NAME
        namespace: $NAMESPACE
        port: 8000
      gateway: $GATEWAY
      rules:
        - path: /*
          methods: ["GET"]
          noAuth: true
        - path: /post
          methods: ["POST"]
          noAuth: true
    EOF
    ```
    
    The host domain name will be obtained from the referenced Gateway.
> [!NOTE]
> If you are using k3d, add `httpbin.kyma.local` to the entry with k3d IP in your system's `/etc/hosts` file.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't specify a namespace for your Service, the default namespace is used.

### Access Your Workload

To access your HTTPBin Service, use [curl](https://curl.se).

- Send a `GET` request to the HTTPBin Service.

  ```bash
  curl -ik -X GET https://httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/ip
  ```
  If successful, the call returns the `200 OK` response code.

- Send a `POST` request to the HTTPBin Service.

  ```bash
  curl -ik -X POST https://httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/post -d "test data"
  ```
  If successful, the call returns the `200 OK` response code.
