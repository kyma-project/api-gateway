# Expose a Workload with Short Host Name

This tutorial demonstrates how to expose an unsecured Service instance using a short host name instead of the full domain name. Using a short host makes it simpler to apply APIRules because the domain name is automatically retrieved from the referenced Gateway, and you donâ€™t have to manually set it in each APIRule. This might be particularly useful when reconfiguring resources in a new cluster, as it reduces the chance of errors and streamlines the process.

> [!WARNING]
>  Exposing a workload to the outside world is a potential security vulnerability, so tread carefully. In a production environment, always secure the workload you expose with [JWT](../../01-50-expose-and-secure-a-workload/v2alpha1/01-52-expose-and-secure-workload-jwt.md).

## Prerequisites

* You have a deployed workload.
* You have [set up your custom domain](../../01-10-setup-custom-domain-for-workload.md). Alternatively, you can use the default domain of your Kyma cluster and the default Gateway `kyma-system/kyma-gateway`.

  >**NOTE**: As Kyma domain is a widlcard domain, which uses a simple TLS gateway, it recommended that you set up your custom domain istead for use in a production environment.
  >**TIP**: 

* To test access to the exposed service, you must install [curl](https://curl.se).

## Steps

### Expose Your Workload
To expose your workload using a short host, replace placeholders and create the following APIRule CR. You can adjust the configuration, if needed.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: gateway.kyma-project.io/v2alpha1
kind: APIRule
metadata:
  name: {APIRULE_NAME}
  namespace: {APIRULE_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  hosts:
    - {SUBDOMAIN}
  service:
    name: {SERVICE_NAME}
    namespace: {SERVICE_NAMESPACE}
    port: {SERVICE_PORT}
  gateway: {NAMESPACE/GATEWAY}
  rules:
    - path: /*
      methods: ["GET"]
      noAuth: true
    - path: /post
      methods: ["POST"]
      noAuth: true
EOF
```

Option | Description
---------|----------
 APIRULE_NAME | Choose a name for the APIRule CR.
 APIRULE_NAMESPACE | Choose the namespace for the APIRule CR.
 SUBDOMAIN | Choose the subdomain name. When using a short host you are not required to specify the full domain.
 SERVICE_NAME | The name of the service to be exposed.
 SERVICE_NAMESPACE | The namespace of the service to be exposed.
 SERVICE_PORT | The port of the service to be exposed.
 NAMESPACE/GATEWAY | The namespace and name of the Istio Gateway to be used.
    
The host domain name is obtained from the referenced Gateway.

### Access Your Workload

- Replace the placeholder and send a `GET` request to the service.

  ```bash
  curl -ik -X GET https://{FULL_DOMAIN_NAME}/ip
  ```
  If successful, the call returns the `200 OK` response code.

- Replace the placeholder and send a `POST` request to the service.

  ```bash
  curl -ik -X POST https://{FULL_DOMAIN_NAME}/post -d "test data"
  ```
  If successful, the call returns the `200 OK` response code.
