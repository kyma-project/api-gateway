# Tutorials - Expose and Secure a Workload
Browse the API Gateway tutorials to learn how to expose and secure workloads. The tutorials are available in two versions: one uses the APIRule resource in version `v2alpha1` and the other uses the APIRule resource in version `v1beta1`. 

> [!WARNING]
> APIRule in version `v1beta1` will become deprecated in 2024. To prepare for the introduction of the stable APIRule in version `v2`, you can start testing the API and the migration process using version `v2alpha1`. APIRule in version `v2alpha1` was introduced for testing purposes only and is not meant for use in a production environment. For more information, see the [APIRule migration blog post](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-btp-kyma-runtime-apirule-migration-noauth-and-jwt-handlers/ba-p/13882833).
