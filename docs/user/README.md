# API Gateway

## What is API Gateway

API Gateway provides functionalities that allow you to expose and secure APIs by using [Ory Oathkeeper](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper) and the [Istio Service Mesh](https://istio.io/) resources.

## Kyma API Gateway Operator

Kyma API Gateway Operator is a component of the Kyma runtime that handles resource reconciliation and manages the application of API Gateway configuration. Within the API Gateway Operator, there are two controllers: the [APIGateway Controller](./00-10-overview-api-gateway-controller.md), which applies the configuration specified in the APIGateway custom resource (CR), and the [APIRule Controller](./00-20-overview-api-rule-controller.md), which applies the configuration specified in the APIRule CR.
