// Package hashbasedstate provides types and functions to compare objects by a hash and a position in a yaml sequence.
//
// The hashbasedstate package should only be used objects unmarshalled from a yaml sequences as they have a defined order.
// The comparison is based on labels for a hash and an index put on a kubernetes object. The hash label holds the hash that
// represents the object and the index value holds the position of the object in the sequence. Both of this information is
// then used to identify if an object was changed, removed or newly added.
//
// Since this comparison is based on the order of objects, it means that adding a new object before an existing object in the
// sequence triggers an update for all the following objects, since their position in the sequence has changed.
