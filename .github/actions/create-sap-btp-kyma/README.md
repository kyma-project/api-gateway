# Create SAP BTP Kyma action

This action creates a new SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) Kyma runtime.
It requires an already existing, valid global account and a bot user with the subaccount administrator role.

The baseline for this action was created by Serverless module team in `https://github.com/kyma-project/terraform-module`.
